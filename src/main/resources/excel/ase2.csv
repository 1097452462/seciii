While the usefulness of DTW methods is well established in automatic speech recognition, they were never directly and quantitatively validated as a way of aligning and comparing signals from different speakers in a way that is useful for the study of speech as a biological process. This paper provides the first direct quantitative validation of such an audio-based temporal alignment algorithm, itself based on a new divide-and-warp strategy, using speaker invariant temporal landmarks from articulatory data. Results demonstrate that the proposed temporal alignment algorithm accurately brings these landmarks into correspondence between speakers (mean absolute delay of ~ 35ms).","","","10.1109/ICASSP.2017.7953201","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7953201","Temporal alignment;dynamic time warping;between-speaker comparisons;validation;articulatory measurements","Speech;Time measurement;Lips;Tongue;Speech recognition;Heuristic algorithms","speaker recognition;time warp simulation","speaker invariant temporal landmarks;divide-and-warp strategy;audio-based temporal alignment algorithm;direct quantitative validation;audio signals;DTW;dynamic time warping;speech rate discrepancies;dynamically evolving articulatory measurements;speech-induced articulatory measurements;time 35 ms","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, von Mises-Fisher mixture models (VMMs) have also been gaining popularity in modelling high-dimensional unit-normalized features such as text documents and gene expression data. VMMs are potentially more efficient in modeling certain speech representations such as i-vector data when compared to the GMM-based models, as they work with unit-normalized features based on cosine distance. The current work investigates the applicability of Dirichlet process VMMs (DPVMMs) for i-vector-based speaker clustering and verification, showing that they indeed show superior performance in comparison to DPGMMs in the tasks.

To reduce the dimensionality of the search space, we extract several principal components from the residual vectors between every long utterance i-vector in a development set and its truncated short utterance i-vector. Then an input i-vector of the network is transformed by linear combination of these directions. In this case, network outputs correspond to weights for linear combination of principal components. We use public speech databases to evaluate the method.

The ability of humans to speak effortlessly requires the coordinated movements of various articulators, muscles, etc. This effortless movement contributes towards a naturalness, intelligibility and speaker's identity (which is partially present in voice converted speech). Hence, during voice conversion (VC), the information related to the speech production is lost. In this paper, this loss is quantified for a male voice, by showing an increase in RMSE error (up to 12.7 % in tongue tip) for voice converted speech followed by showing a decrease in mutual information (I) (by 8.7 %). Similar results are obtained in the case of a female voice. This observation is extended by showing that the articulatory features can be used as an objective measure. The effectiveness of the proposed measure over MCD is illustrated by comparing their correlation with a Mean Opinion Score (MOS). Moreover, the preference score of MCD contradicted ABX test by 100 %, whereas the proposed measure supported ABX test by 45.8 % and 16.7 % in the case of female-to-male and male-to-female VC, respectively.","","","10.1109/ICASSP.2017.7953211","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7953211","voice conversion;acoustic-to-articulatory inversion;articulatory features","Speech;Acoustics;Trajectory;Tongue;Acoustic measurements;Training;Production","acoustic signal processing;mean square error methods;speech processing","voice converted speech quality assessment;articulatory features;acoustic- to-articulatory inversion;AAI;naturalness measure;intelligibility measure;speaker identity measure;voice conversion;male voice;RMSE error;tongue tip;mutual information;female voice;objective measure;preference score;MCD contradicted ABX test;measure supported ABX test;female-to-male VC;male-to-female VC","","3","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The first algorithm uses a forward selection procedure to build the exemplar set sequentially, selecting exemplar pairs that minimize the joint reconstruction error on source and target frames. The second algorithm uses a backward elimination procedure to remove exemplars that contribute the least to the factorization. We evaluate both selection strategies on voice conversion tasks using the ARCTIC corpus. Our results using objective measures and subjective listening tests show that both strategies can significantly reduce the size of the exemplar set (five-fold, in our experiments) while achieving the same performance on voice conversion.","","","10.1109/ICASSP.2017.7953213","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7953213","voice conversion;sparse reconstruction;exemplar selection","Training;Acoustics;Sparse matrices;Speech;Matrix decomposition;Hidden Markov models;Approximation algorithms","matrix decomposition;set theory;speaker recognition","exemplar selection methods;voice conversion;randomly selected exemplars;forward selection procedure;joint reconstruction error;target frames;backward elimination procedure;ARCTIC corpus","","2","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We evaluate an speaker verification system trained with the i-vector framework with a probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) back-end. The study relies on a subset of the MSP-PODCAST corpus, which has naturalistic recordings from 40 speakers. We train the system with neutral speech, creating mismatches on the testing set.

In this paper, several fusion approaches are proposed for noise-robust reverberation time estimation. More specifically, feature- and score-level fusion of short- and long-term speech temporal dynamics features are proposed.

This paper reports an approach to ABE based on the constant Q transform (CQT), a more perceptually motivated approach to spectral analysis. A Gaussian mixture model is used to estimate missing highband components from available narrowband components before resynthesis with phase estimates obtained from the upsampled narrowband signal.

Experimental results demonstrate our method can outperform the comparison methods over 2-15.6% and 2.9-15.4% on the English corpus and Mandarin corpus in terms of relative F1-measure, respectively.","","","10.1109/ICASSP.2017.7953231","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7953231","emphasis detection;cross-lingual;multilingual;bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM)","Speech;Acoustics;Training data;Recurrent neural networks;Speech recognition;Feature extraction;Support vector machines","human computer interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;recurrent neural nets;speech processing;speech recognition;speech synthesis","speech synthesis;human-computer interaction;Mandarin corpus;English corpus;softmax output layer;MTL-BLSTM model;natural speech;emphasized speech segment recognition;contextual information capture;sequence processing problems;RNN;recurrent neural network;bidirectional long short-term memory;limited training data;emphasis detection;multilingual BLSTM;cross-lingual knowledge learning","","5","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Previous studies have shown that speech information encodes significant behavioral information and be used in a variety of automated behavior recognition tasks. However, extracting behavior information from speech is still a difficult task due to the sparseness of training data coupled with the complex, high-dimensionality of speech, and the complex and multiple information streams it encodes. In this work we exploit the slow varying properties of human behavior. We hypothesize that nearby segments of speech share the same behavioral context and hence share a similar underlying representation in a latent space. Specifically, we propose a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model to connect behavioral context and derive the behavioral manifold in an unsupervised manner. We evaluate the proposed manifold in the couples therapy domain and also provide examples from publicly available data (e.g. stand-up comedy). We further investigate training within the couples' therapy domain and from movie data. The results are extremely encouraging and promise improved behavioral quantification in an unsupervised manner and warrants further investigation in a range of applications.","","","10.1109/ICASSP.2017.7953232","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7953232","Behavior Signal Processing;manifold learning;unsupervised learning;behavior representation","Manifolds;Medical treatment;Training;Context;Acoustics;Speech;Feature extraction","acoustic signal processing;behavioural sciences computing;information retrieval;neural nets;unsupervised learning","unsupervised latent behavior manifold learning;acoustic features;audio2behavior;signal processing;machine learning;training data;behavioral labels;automated behavior recognition;behavior annotation;behavior information extraction;complex information streams;multiple information streams;behavioral context;deep neural network model;DNN model;behavioral manifold;couples therapy domain;movie data;behavioral quantification","","1","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, representation learning has emerged as an active research topic in many machine learning applications owing largely to its excellent performance. In the context of natural language processing, the pioneering work can date back to the word embedding methods. However, learning of paragraph (or sentence and document) representations is more reasonable and suitable for some tasks, such as information retrieval and document summarization. Nevertheless, as far as we are aware, there is relatively less work focusing on launching paragraph embedding methods into SDR. Motivated by these observations, this paper proposes a novel paragraph embedding method, named the locality-preserving essence vector (LPEV) model. LPEV is designed with consideration to two aspects. First, the model aims at not only distilling the most representative information from a paragraph but also getting rid of the general background information. Second, inspired by the local invariance perspective, which is a celebrated principle used in manifold learning techniques, LPEV also manages to preserve semantic locality in the learned low-dimensional embedding space for producing more informative and discriminative vector representations of paragraphs. On top of the proposed framework, a series of empirical SDR experiments conducted on the TDT-2 (Topic Detection and Tracking) collection demonstrate the good efficacy of our SDR methods as compared to existing strong baselines.","","","10.1109/ICASSP.2017.7953241","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7953241","Representation;spoken document retrieval;locality;distill","Semantics;Training;Context;Artificial neural networks;Linear programming;Context modeling","information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);speech processing","locality-preserving essence vector modeling framework;spoken document retrieval;paragraph embedding method;LPEV model;local invariance perspective;manifold learning technique;semantic locality preserve;learned low-dimensional embedding space;informative discriminative vector representations;TDT-2;topic detection and tracking;SDR method","","2","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The combination of lexical and acoustic features achieves a significant improvement in F-Measure of 1.5 absolute over the purely lexical neural machine translation based system.","","","10.1109/ICASSP.2017.7953248","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7953248","punctuation;speech recognition;neural machine translation;rich transcription","Acoustics;Training;Stochastic processes;Hidden Markov models;Speech;Decoding;Data models","acoustic signal processing;decoding;encoding;language translation;neural nets;speech recognition","sequence-to-sequence models;punctuated transcription;lexical features;acoustic features;neural machine translation;word level representations;encoder-decoder architecture;hierarchical encoder;punctuation marks;F-measure;speech recognition","","3","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To accurately model the sophisticated long-term information in human languages, large memory in language models is necessary. However, the size of RNN-based language models cannot be arbitrarily increased because the computational resources required and the model complexity will also be increase accordingly, due to the limitation of the structure. To overcome this problem, inspired from Neural Turing Machine and Memory Network, we equip RNN-based language models with controllable external memory. With a learnable memory controller, the size of the external memory is independent to the number of model parameters, so the proposed language model can have larger memory without increasing the parameters.

Low-resourced languages are characterized by limited training materials, which typically results in high out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rates and poor language model estimates. One technique makes use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) using word or subword units. Word-based RNNs keep the same system vocabulary, so they cannot reduce the OOV, whereas subword units can reduce the OOV but generate many false combinations. A complementary technique is based on automatic machine translation, which requires parallel texts and is able to add words to the vocabulary. These methods were assessed on 10 languages in the context of the Babel program and NIST OpenKWS evaluation. Although improvements vary across languages with both methods, small gains were generally observed in terms of word error rate reduction and improved keyword search performance.","","","10.1109/ICASSP.2017.7953266","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7953266","multilingual;low resourced languages;speech recognition;keyword search","Training;Vocabulary;Data models;Keyword search;Recurrent neural networks;NIST;Error analysis","natural language processing;recurrent neural nets;speech recognition","language model data augmentation;low-resourced STT;KWS;low-resourced automatic speech recognition;keyword search;out-of-vocabulary rates;language model estimates;recurrent neural networks;word-based RNN;complementary technique;automatic machine translation;Babel program;NIST OpenKWS evaluation;word error rate reduction","","3","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Typically, the syllable stress depends on three prominence measures - intensity level, duration, pitch - around the sound unit with the highest sonority in the respective syllable. Stress detection is often formulated as a binary classification task using cues from the feature contours representing the prominence measures. We observe that cues from a feature contour obtained by incorporating relative sonority levels in the prominence measures are more indicative of the syllable stress compared to those from the feature contours representing only the prominence measures. Based on this observation, we propose a new feature contour based on temporal correlation selected sub-band correlation with an optimal set of sub-bands, called sonorous sub-bands, to maximize the stress detection accuracy. Experiments on ISLE corpus show that, for German and Italian non-native English speakers, the syllable stress detection accuracies (87.53% and 86.26%) are higher when the proposed features are used compared to the baseline accuracies (85.81% and 83.17%) indicating the effectiveness of the sonority based prominence features.","","","10.1109/ICASSP.2017.7953277","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7953277","Sonorous TCSSBC (S-TCSSBC);syllable stress detection;sonority based features;prominence measures;forward sub-band selection","Stress;Feature extraction;Stress measurement;Correlation;Indexes;Speech;Energy measurement","feature extraction;signal classification;speech processing","sub-band correlation;temporal correlation;feature contours;binary classification task;pitch;duration;intensity level;prominence measures;second language learners;pronunciation quality;pronunciation evaluation;sonority based prominence features;syllable stress detection","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition, how to impose regularizers on the sought canonical components was unclear - while structure-promoting regularizers are often desired in practice.

Through introducing a cost function that underrates the importance of those observations with small innovations, we develop the first censoring strategy based on the alternating minimization algorithm and the stochastic Newton method. It saves computation when a datum is censored. The computation and communication costs are further reduced by the second censoring strategy, which prohibits a node updating and transmitting its local estimate to neighbors when its current innovation is less than a threshold. For both strategies, a simple criterion for selecting the threshold of innovation is given so as to reach a target ratio of data reduction.

Different from the stationary setting where the GSO and the covariance matrix of the observed signals are simultaneously diagonalizable, here they are not. Hence, estimating the eigenvectors requires first estimating the unknown diffusion (graph) filter - a polynomial in the GSO which does preserve the sought eigenbasis.

Most state-of-art approaches address this either by designing hand-engineered features or breaking up the problem over homogeneous variates. In this work, we formulate the (rare) event prediction task as a classification problem with a novel asymmetric loss function and propose an end-to-end deep learning algorithm over symbolic representations of time-series. Symbolic representations are fed into an embedding layer and a Long Short Term Memory Neural Network (LSTM) layer which are trained to learn discriminative features.

In contrast to other systems that modulate lights, the proposed system distinguishes lights by learning from training samples. Due to slight differences in the electronic components used in the construction of compact fluorescent light (CFL) and light emitting diode (LED) bulbs, the optical signals emitted by each light bulb have slight differences with other light bulbs even within the same brand and model. Light signals are digitized with a fast and accurate analog-to-digital converter (ADC) at up to 1 mega-samples/second, segmented, and mapped into the frequency domain using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Spectral features based on the FFT are filtered, normalized, and used as training data for supervised machine learning algorithms. Results are provided for two classifiers of varying complexity: (1) A k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier; (2) A Convolutional Neural Net (CNN) classifier.

The approach develops a weighted kernel fisher sparse analysis method based on multiple maps. The proposed method consists of maps extraction and kernel weighted Fisher sparse analysis. Two maps are firstly extracted from each audio file, i.e. scale-frequency map and damping-frequency map. The scale and frequency of the Gabor atoms are extracted to construct a scale-frequency map. On the other hand, the damping-frequency map is generated according to the frequency and damping factor of damped atoms. Gabor atoms can be utilized to model human auditory perception, and the damped atoms can be used to model commonly observed damped oscillations in natural signals. This work fuses the advantages of these two dictionaries to improve the performance of the system. During the recognition stage, this work constructs a kernel sparse representation-based classifier via the proposed kernel weighted Fisher sparse analysis to enhance separability. The proposed kernel weighted Fisher sparse analysis combines sparse representation with heteroscedastic kernel weighted discriminant analysis (HKWDA), which is useful for providing a discriminative recognition of audio events because a weighted pairwise Chernoff criterion is utilized in the kernel space. Experiments on a 20-class audio event database indicate that the proposed approach can achieve an accuracy rate of 82.70%.

The current state-of-the-art convolutional sparse coding (CSC) algorithms achieve their computational efficiency by applying the convolutions in the frequency domain. It has been shown that any given 2D non-separable filter bank can be approximated as a linear combination of a relatively small number of separable filters. This approximation has been exploited for computationally efficient CNN implementations, but has thus far not been considered for convolutional sparse coding. In this paper we propose a computationally efficient algorithm, that apply the convolution in the spatial domain, to solve the CSC problem when the corresponding dictionary filters are separable.

The simultaneous reduction of noise and motion blur from the low-light color images is difficult because the imposed noise hinders accurate motion blur kernel estimation. To overcome this problem, we build a novel imaging system using a single sensor that captures red, green, blue (RGB) and near-infrared (NIR) images. Our imaging system captures low-light scenes with exposure bracketing, which is a technique to acquire multiple images with different exposure times. It thus allows us to obtain the short- and long-exposure RGB/NIR images. Both the short- and long-exposure NIR images taken using an NIR flash unit can be captured with less noise; thus they enable estimation of motion blur kernel accurately. Based on this fact, we perform joint denoising and deblurring of the low-light color image with the estimated motion blur kernel. Our experiments using real raw data captured by our imaging system demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.","","","10.1109/ICASSP.2017.7953319","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7953319","low-light image restoration;RGB/NIR single sensor;exposure bracketing;denoising;deblurring","Color;Kernel;Imaging;Image restoration;Noise reduction;Estimation;Image reconstruction","image colour analysis;image denoising;image motion analysis;image restoration","RGB-NIR imaging;exposure bracketing;low-light color images deblurring;low-light color images denoising;noise reduction;motion blur reduction;motion blur kernel estimation;red green blue images;RGB images;near-infrared images;NIR images;NIR flash unit","","4","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the approximation limits the resolution while the explicit inverse is computationally complex and mostly ill-conditioned. This paper proposes a partitioned inverse (PI) approach based on the Moore-Penrose pseudo inverse using truncated singular value decomposition for regularization, which is robust to noise. It is shown that PI has an improved resolution of 24% over MF even at 0 dB SNR and is three orders of magnitude faster than the explicit inverse.

For this we use the Bayesian approach with a prior model in which the relationship between the image and its contour is considered by using a hierarchical Markovian model, and use a sparsity enforcing prior model for the contours.

A complete approach is presented for partitioning arbitrary dictionaries into two parts, so as to obtain the optimal coherence bounds on recovery, along with a proof of optimality. A heuristic is provided for recursive application of the splitting algorithm to further improve upon these bounds, using a multi-way dictionary split. We analyze cases where an appropriate split in the dictionary predicts less conservative signal sparsity bounds for successful recovery than those considering the dictionary as a monolithic block.

This will corrupt any direction dependent method, such as beamforming. Regression has been used to predict time-frequency (TF) regions corrupted by reverberation, and static broadband noise can be efficiently estimated for TF points. TF regions dominated by noise or reverberation can then be de-emphasized to obtain more reliable source direction estimates.

In many practical situations, robots must be able to identify and focus on sources of interest in the presence of interfering speakers. Techniques such as spatial filtering and blind source separation are therefore often used, but rely on accurate knowledge of the source location. In practice, sound emitted in enclosed environments is subject to reverberation and noise. Hence, sound source localization must be robust to both diffuse noise due to late reverberation, as well as spurious detections due to early reflections. For improved robustness against reverberation, this paper proposes a novel approach for sound source tracking that constructively exploits the spatial diversity of a microphone array installed in a moving robot. In previous work, we developed speaker localization approaches using expectation-maximization (EM) approaches and using Bayesian approaches.

Since little is known about the latent processes underlying neural function, it is important to minimize the assumptions placed on the data when performing a joint analysis. This motivates the use of data-driven fusion methods, such as independent vector analysis (IVA), for the analysis of neurological data. For neural datasets, the complementary information exploited by fusion methods may be in the form of similar spatial activation across datasets, the spatial IVA (sIVA) model, or similar subject relations across datasets, the transposed IVA (tIVA) model. Despite the potential power of these two models, no study has investigated how the differences in the modeling assumptions of sIVA and tIVA inform the fusion of real neuro-imaging data. In this paper, we utilize a unique set of multitask functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 271 subjects to directly compare the sIVA and tIVA models and visualize their differences using a novel technique, global difference maps. Through this application, we note important similarities between the results from the two methods that increase our confidence in their overall performance, though differences in modeling assumptions result in certain differences in the decompositions.","","","10.1109/ICASSP.2017.7953341","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7953341","FMRI;Data Fusion;Independent Vector Analysis","Brain modeling;Data models;Biomarkers;Feature extraction;Computational modeling;Spatial databases;Sensors","biomedical MRI;image fusion;medical image processing;neurophysiology","multitask functional magnetic resonance imaging;neuroimaging data;transposed IVA model;spatial activation;neural datasets;neurological data analysis;spatial IVA model;independent vector analysis;data-driven fusion methods;neural function;latent processes;neurological sensors;medical imaging data;image fusion","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Similarity-constraint encoders as introduced in this paper specifically address these challenges for feature learning. They learn features that allow to distinguish between classes by demanding that encodings of two trials from the same class are more similar to each other than to encoded trials from other classes. This tuple-based training approach is especially suitable for small datasets. The proposed technique is evaluated using the publicly available OpenMIIR dataset of EEG recordings taken while participants listened to and imagined music.

The endmembers and their abundances in each pixel are extracted region-wise, instead of globally to mitigate spectral variability effects, which are less severe locally. However, it requires the local estimation of the number of endmembers to use. Algorithms for intrinsic dimensionality (ID) estimation tend to overestimate the local ID, especially in small regions. The ID only provides an upper bound of the application and scale dependent number of endmembers, which leads to extract irrelevant signatures as local endmembers, associated with meaningless local abundances. We propose a method to select in each region the best subset of the locally extracted endmembers. Collaborative sparsity is used to detect spurious endmembers in each region and only keep the most influent ones. We compute an algorithmic regularization path for this problem, giving access to the sequence of successive active sets of endmembers when the regularization parameter is increased. Finally, we select the optimal set in the sense of the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), favoring models with a high likelihood, while penalizing those with too many endmembers.

The traditional applications of such classifiers to hyperspectral imagery utilize pixel (sample) level information, not spatial contextual information.

We demonstrate an experimentally robust reconstruction algorithm based on a 2nd order quasi-Newton's method, combined with a novel phase initialization scheme. To further extend the Gigapixel imaging capability to 3D, we develop a reconstruction method to process the 4D light field measurements from sequential illumination scanning. The algorithm is based on a `multi-slice' forward model that incorporates both 3D phase and diffraction effects, as well as multiple forward scatterings. To solve the inverse problem, an iterative update procedure that combines both phase retrieval and `error back-propagation' is developed. To avoid local minimum solutions, we further develop a novel physical model-based initialization technique that accounts for both the geometric-optic and 1st order phase effects. The result is robust reconstructions of Gigapixel 3D phase images having both wide FOV and super resolution in all three dimensions.

The initial deformation in the tissue is typically induced through an external mechanical force, for example, by exerting a slight pressure using an ultrasound probe or by applying an acoustic radiation force (ARF) against the tissue. The ARF excites the tissue locally, which leads to the propagation of a shear-wave. The goal of the shear-wave elastography is to estimate the speed of the shear-wave that is explicitly related to the elasticity of tissue. We formulate tissue displacement estimation as an optimization problem and propose a computationally efficient approach to estimate the displacement field. A novel algorithm based on the minimization of a regularized cost function using higher-order analytical minimization (HAM) coupled with the second-order Taylor series approximation is proposed. Our algorithm first computes an integer displacement field based on dynamic programming (DP) that provides the global optima, which is then refined iteratively to obtain the subpixel displacement estimate.

Then, signals from a given beam not necessarily occupy the full bandwidth but only specific subcarriers. In addition, due to the wideband of the signal, each RF chain introduces frequency dependent gain and phase shift that need to be calibrated to perform a subsequent demultiplexing in a digital beamforming matrix.

The proposed approach is tested on both synthetic and real resting-state fMRI data, with the former illustrating the gains in directed edge presence detection performance, as compared to existing PGC methods, and with the latter highlighting differences in the estimated test statistics.","","","10.1109/ICASSP.2017.7953369","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7953369","fMRI;partial Granger causality;partial correlation;kernel-based regression;multiple kernel learning","Kernel;Correlation;Brain modeling;Time series analysis;Data models;Ear","biomedical MRI;brain;edge detection;medical image processing;statistical testing;topology","directional connections;brain networks;multikernel Granger models;partial Granger causality;brain regions;multikernel based nonlinear model;undirected topology identification;PGC;nonlinear connectivity models;real resting-state fMRI data;directed edge presence detection performance;test statistics","","1","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Theoretical analysis shows that collecting a sufficient number of such features can be reliably used for subsequent inference in kernel classification and regression. In this work, we demonstrate that with a mild increase in the dimension of the embedding, it is also possible to reconstruct the data vector from such random sinusoidal features, provided that the underlying data is sparse enough. In particular, we propose a numerically stable algorithm for reconstructing the data vector given the nonlinear features, and analyze its sample complexity. Our algorithm can be extended to other types of structured inverse problems, such as demixing a pair of sparse (but incoherent) vectors.

However, both syntactic and differential privacy are susceptible to inference attacks, i.e., an adversary can accurately guess sensitive attributes from insensitive attributes.

Solutions proposed to the problem in the literature generally invoke homomorphic encryption schemes, secure multi-party computation, or other cryptographic methods which introduce significant computational complexity into the proceedings, often to the point of making more complex computations requiring repeated computations unfeasible. Other solutions invoke third parties, making unrealistic assumptions about their trustworthiness. In this paper we propose an alternate approach, also based on third party computation, but without assuming as much trust in the third party. Individual participants to the computation “secure” their data through a proposed secure hashing scheme with shared keys, prior to sharing it with the third party. The hashing ensures that the third party cannot recover any information about the individual signals or their statistics, either from analysis of individual computations or their long-term aggregate patterns.

The obtained column and row spaces are updated in each iteration to converge to the column and row spaces of the low rank matrix. The informative columns are located using the information embedded in the row space while the informative rows are identified using the information embedded in the column space.","","","10.1109/ICASSP.2017.7953392","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7953392","Robust PCA;Randomized Method;Subspace Recovery;Low Rank Matrix;Matrix Decomposition","Matrix decomposition;Sparse matrices;Standards;Pursuit algorithms;Robustness;World Wide Web;Computers","Big Data;matrix decomposition;optimisation;sampling methods;sparse matrices","high dimensional decomposition;coherent/structured matrices;sequential column/row sampling;low rank plus sparse matrix decomposition;big data;high-dimensional optimization;blind random sampling","","1","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The observer aims to find an optimal sampling strategy and a decision rule to maximize the error exponent (per sample). We focus on sequential strategies, in which the sampling actions depend on the observations taken so far. We first derive performance bounds of any sequential sampling strategy.

The performance potential is mainly conditioned to the use of digital beamforming techniques which demand one radio-frequency (RF) chain per antenna element. For large arrays, this implementation may result in high complexity, power consumption, and cost. To reduce the number of RF chains, we use a hybrid beamforming (HB) architecture of an analog beamformer implemented by using phase-shifters and a low-dimensional digital beamformer. The performance of the HB depends on the resolution of the phase-shifters. However, very few works in the literature take into account finite phase-shifters. In this paper, we address the problem of designing HB in frequency selective channels using finite-resolution phase-shifters. The strategy is to exploit the second-order statistics of the channel and a least-square formulation to obtain the discrete phase of each phase-shifter. The digital part is derived based on analog solution to maximize the single-user MIMO system sum-rate. This solution requires a number of RF chains compared to the rank of the spatial covariance matrix which is far lower than ones demanded to implement the full digital beamforming. The simulation results show that the proposed technique can achieve a sum-rate performance very close to that of the digital beamforming assuming low-rank channels.","","","10.1109/ICASSP.2017.7953408","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7953408","Massive MIMO;hybrid beamforming;phase-shifters;alternating least-squares","MIMO;Radio frequency;Array signal processing;Covariance matrices;Wideband;Transmitting antennas","antenna arrays;array signal processing;covariance matrices;least squares approximations;MIMO communication;phase shifters;spectral analysis;statistics;wireless channels","spatial covariance matrix;single-user MIMO system sum-rate maximization;least-square formulation;second-order statistics;HB architecture;low-dimensional digital beamformer;analog beamformer;RF chains;power consumption;antenna arrays;antenna element;radiofrequency chain;wireless communications;spectral efficiency;massive multiple-input multiple-output theoretical performance results;frequency selective massive MIMO channels;finite-resolution phase-shifters;hybrid beamforming design","","3","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we consider the uplink of a multiuser massive MIMO system in the presence of blockers. Such blockers, which arise from, for example, users served by other non-cooperative base stations (BSs), can limit the system performance if not handled properly. We propose a HBF scheme that can remove the impact of blockers, while preserving signals from intended users. Specifically, in our two-step receive beamforming scheme, the analog beamformer (ABF) is designed based on channel covariance matrices to minimize the powers of blockers, while the digital beamformer (DBF) deals with inter-user interference. We propose an iterative algorithm that efficiently gives a good sub-optimal solution to the NP-hard problem in the ABF design. Moreover, we consider a more complete BS architecture by incorporating automatic gain control (AGC) and analog-to-digital converter (ADC). As we show in the simulations, for a system with full-precision ADCs, our scheme approaches the sum rate of an ideal fully-digital system. Interestingly, for a system with low-resolution ADCs, our HBF scheme can even outperform a fully-digital system.","","","10.1109/ICASSP.2017.7953409","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7953409","","MIMO;Covariance matrices;Array signal processing;Symmetric matrices;Quantization (signal);Uplink;Gain control","analogue-digital conversion;array signal processing;automatic gain control;computational complexity;covariance matrices;intercarrier interference;iterative methods;MIMO communication;optimisation","hybrid beamforming;HBF;uplink massive MIMO systems;blocker presence;baseband hardware cost;multiple-input multiple-output systems;multiuser massive MIMO system;noncooperative base stations;two-step receive beamforming scheme;analog beamformer;channel covariance matrix;digital beamformer;iterative algorithm;NP-hard problem;automatic gain control;AGC;analog-to-digital converter;ADC;inter-user interference","","2","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The actual data structure is however often unknown a priori but can sometimes be estimated from the knowledge of the application domain. If this is not possible, the data structure has to be inferred from the mere signal observations. This is exactly the problem that we address in this paper, under the assumption that the graph signals can be represented as a sparse linear combination of a few atoms of a structured graph dictionary. The dictionary is constructed on polynomials of the graph Laplacian, which can sparsely represent a general class of graph signals composed of localized patterns on the graph. We formulate a graph learning problem, whose solution provides an ideal fit between the signal observations and the sparse graph signal model. As the problem is non-convex, we propose to solve it by alternating between a signal sparse coding and a graph update step. We provide experimental results that outline the good graph recovery performance of our method, which generally compares favourably to other recent network inference algorithms.","","","10.1109/ICASSP.2017.7953413","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7953413","graph learning;graph signal processing;Laplacian matrix;sparse signal prior;graph dictionary","Dictionaries;Kernel;Laplace equations;Sparse matrices;Matching pursuit algorithms;Optimization;Signal processing","data structures;graph theory;Laplace equations;learning (artificial intelligence);polynomials;signal representation","graph learning;sparsity priors;data representation;irregular structures;data structure;graph signal representation;structured graph dictionary;graph Laplacian polynomials;localized patterns;sparse graph signal model;nonconvex problem;signal sparse coding;graph update;graph recovery performance","","6","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The cooperative system under consideration suffers from two types of interferences, the residual self-interference (RSI) and IQI. To evaluate the system performance gain using IGS, first we express the end-to-end achievable rate for different IQI.

Analog SI isolation is performed at radio frequency (RF) by utilizing an antenna design based on the characteristic modes theory and using active cancellation principle. Phase and attenuation values of the active cancellation signal path are tuned while transmitting a data signal to a distant node. After the tuning the SI isolation at RF is 90 dB. The remaining SI is then cancelled at baseband. For the baseband SI cancellation an estimate of the SI channel is needed.

We introduce a digital predistortion architecture that linearizes the response of the PA in a full-duplex transceiver. Specifically, we propose a two-step procedure to estimate the predistorter parameters and the SI canceller coefficients. Different from a direct application of conventional predistorters, the proposed architecture does not need an extra RF chain to estimate the PA response and exploits the inherent SI signal instead. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed scheme is able to increase significantly the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio at the transceiver output and to reduce out-of-band emissions when compared to linear and nonlinear cancellation without predistortion.","","","10.1109/ICASSP.2017.7953421","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7953421","Full duplex;self-interference;nonlinear distortion;spectral regrowth;digital predistortion","Relays;Radio frequency;Nonlinear distortion;OFDM;Channel estimation","interference suppression;linearisation techniques;power amplifiers;radio transceivers","power amplifier linearization;full-duplex transceivers;RF chain;peak-to-average power ratio;self-interference cancellation;digital predistortion architecture;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;nonlinear cancellation","","2","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The objective is to contribute to tackle the problem of missed detection of inundated vegetation by near real-time flood mapping algorithms using SAR data. The focus is on CSK because its four-satellite constellation is very suitable for rapid mapping. A set of CSK observations of an area in Northern Italy where many rice fields are present and recurrent artificial inundations occur were analyzed. Considering that double-bounce is the key process to detect floodwater under vegetation and that polarimetry is potentially able to discriminate double-bounce among different scattering mechanisms, single polarization CSK observations were compared with ALOS-2 and RADARSAT-2 fully polarimetric data. Such a multifrequency and multiangle dataset helped understanding the multitemporal signature of CSK data. A set of Landsat-8 images collected under cloud free conditions were also used as reference. Satellite acquisitions were gathered in order to ensure both spatial overlap among the images of the various sensors and temporal overlap along most of the rice growing season. The comparison between CSK and polarimetric data showed that at least for a slender leaf plant like rice, CSK can be able to detect the enhancement of double-bounce backscattering involving water and vertical plant stems. For some selected fields, it was found a good agreement between CSK-derived floodwater maps and those produced using the normalized-difference water index derived from Landsat-8 images, as well as double-bounce detection from polarimetric data.","","","10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2711960","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7953430","COSMO-SkyMed (CSK);flooded vegetation;polarimetry","Vegetation mapping;Synthetic aperture radar;Scattering;Satellites;Earth;Remote sensing","floods;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;vegetation","mapping flooded vegetation;COSMO-SkyMed;polarimetric data;optical data;remotely sense standing water;flood mapping algorithms;ALOS-2 polarimetric data;RADARSAT-2 polarimetric data;satellite acquisitions;Landsat-8 images;double-bounce backscattering","","","","","19 June 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, it further strengthens security and privacy in 5G networks.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2716971","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7953431","Public key encryption;equality test;privacy-preserving;verification;cloud computing;5G networks","Electronic mail;Public key;Servers;Authorization;Receivers;Encryption","5G mobile communication;authorisation;cloud computing;data privacy;public key cryptography;telecommunication security","verifiable public key encryption scheme;equality test;5G networks;cloud computing providers;security issues;privacy issues;cloud services;flexible authorization;PKEET-FA;verifiable PKEET scheme;V-PKEET;data privacy;data owners","","6","","","19 June 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Asymmetrically Clipped Absolute Value Optical OFDM for Intensity-Modulated Direct-Detection Systems","R. Bai; Q. Wang; Z.

In this paper, a novel energy and spectrally efficient scheme called asymmetrically clipped absolute value optical OFDM (AAO-OFDM) is proposed for intensity-modulated direct-detection systems. In AAO-OFDM, absolute value optical OFDM (AVO-OFDM) signals on the even subcarriers and asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM (ACO-OFDM) signals on the odd subcarriers are combined for simultaneous transmission, which employs all the subcarriers requiring no dc biases. For AVO-OFDM scheme, the frequency symbols are first modulated on the even subcarriers, which are then fed into an inverse fast Fourier transform block. Afterward, the absolute values of the bipolar time-domain signals are taken to guarantee non-negativity, while their signs are mapped to the complex-valued symbols and modulated on the odd subcarriers. Since there remain unused odd subcarriers, other useful symbols can be modulated on them, which leads to the conventional ACO-OFDM scheme. At the receiver, the ACO-OFDM symbols on the odd subcarriers are demodulated first, which are reconstructed and removed from the received signals. Afterward, the remaining signals are utilized to detect the AVO-OFDM symbols with the aid of the demodulated sign symbols on the odd subcarriers. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that AAO-OFDM has lower peak-to-average power ratio than other optical OFDM schemes, which makes it less sensitive to the nonlinearity of the optical devices. Furthermore, it achieves better bit error rate performance compared to its counterparts for the same spectral efficiency.","","","10.1109/JLT.2017.2716983","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7953432","Energy efficiency;intensity modulation with direct detection;orthogonal frequency division multiplexing;spectral efficiency","OFDM;Optical distortion;Optical receivers;Optical transmitters;Optical modulation;Time-domain analysis;Optical imaging","demodulation;error statistics;fast Fourier transforms;intensity modulation;inverse transforms;OFDM modulation;optical receivers;time-domain analysis","asymmetrically clipped absolute value optical OFDM;intensity-modulated direct-detection systems;orthogonal frequency division multiplexing;optical communication systems;spectral efficiency;frequency-selective channels;AAO-OFDM;absolute value optical OFDM signals;even subcarriers;asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM signals;odd subcarriers;simultaneous transmission;frequency symbols;inverse fast Fourier transform block;bipolar time-domain signals;nonnegativity;complex-valued symbols;conventional ACO-OFDM scheme;optical receiver;ACO-OFDM symbols;received signals;AVO-OFDM symbols;demodulated sign symbols;peak-to-average power ratio;optical OFDM schemes;nonlinearity;optical devices;bit error rate performance","","6","","","19 June 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Radio access technologies for mobile broadband have evolved effectively to provide connectivity to billions of subscribers and things. Current Radio Access Network architecture is undergoing a transformation to increase deployment flexibility and network dynamicity, so that networks will be able to meet the performance requirements demanded by applications such as extreme mobile broadband and long-range massive machine type communication. Next generation 5G networks will cater for a wide range of new business opportunities, some of which have yet to be conceptualized. They will provide support for advanced mobile broadband services such as massive media distribution. Applications like remote operation of machinery, tele-surgery, and smart metering all require connectivity, but with vastly different characteristics. The ability to provide customized connectivity will benefit many industries around the world, enabling them to bring new products and services to market rapidly, and adapt to fast changing demands, all while continuing to offer and expand existing services. To prevent total cost of ownership from soaring, the 5G architecture will be software configurable and split between general purpose and specialized hardware, in a way that enables optimal placement of networks functions.","","","10.23919/ConTEL.2017.8000009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8000009","","Mobile computing;Broadband communication;5G mobile communication;Industries","5G mobile communication;radio access networks","radio access network architecture;next generation 5G networks;advanced mobile broadband services","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

All areas of our information society depend on communication networks as a basic infrastructure. Emerging applications raise the need for dynamic changes of the required networking resources, for example, to react to social events or to shifts of demands over time. Providing the required flexibility to react to those changes and being cost efficient at the same time has recently become a huge challenge in research. With Software Defined Networking (SDN), Network Virtualization and Network Function Virtualization, three concepts for network softwareization have emerged in the networking research, which claim to increase flexibility in networking. However, a deeper understanding of the flexibility vs. cost trade-off is missing so far in networking research. This talk focuses on the challenges of flexible networking, proposes a definition for a flexibility measure, which allows to quantitatively compare different network designs, and will highlight selected solution concepts. Presented research topics include the placement of network functions and the dynamic placement of controllers as well as SDN network virtualization based on a new network hypervisor concept.","","","10.23919/ConTEL.2017.8000010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8000010","","Virtualization","software defined networking;virtualisation","softwarized communication networks;software defined networking;network virtualization;network function virtualization;SDN network","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Advances in creating deception planning processes for cyber security are generally based on military tactics, where deception has a long history. However, the complexity of computer systems demands deception planning processes that fit the needs of integrating deception into traditional software security mechanisms. This paper presents a survey of existing deception planning processes in military and digital realms. The goal of this review is to identify the scope of deception planning models, which tools have been used to plan deception, and how the planning is integrated into other activities in the software development phases. We identified 20 different features in the studies, which we used to compare them. The outcome of this survey can be used to facilitate the understanding of how deception planning has been conducted and supported while identifying potential gaps to be addressed in future research.","","","10.1109/ICCSA.2017.8000014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8000014","","Planning;Computer security;Tools;Databases;Search engines;Systematics","military computing;risk management;security of data","cyber security;deception-based mechanisms;deception planning processes;military tactics;computer system complexity;software security mechanisms;software development phases","","1","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper describes an approach that focuses on business value modeling and uses model-driven techniques to generate the input required by current software service identification methods, thus aligning business and software perspectives. This approach was evaluated in two parts. First, a quasi-experiment evaluates the perceived efficacy of the business perspective, and a proof-of-concept tool was built to check the feasibility of generating typical inputs needed by software service identification methods.

In this paper we present real-time performing wireless UWB-SN hardware demonstrator. Its sensor nodes use M-sequence UWB radars front-end and low-cost ARM based quad-core microcomputer (ARM-MC) as a main signal processing block. The ARM-MC based on Raspberry Pi provides processing power for the preprocessing of received raw radar signals, algorithms for detection and estimation of target's coordinates, and finally compression of data sent to the data fusion center. Low-rate data streams (3600-6000 bits/s/node) of compressed target coordinates are sent from each sensor node to the data fusion center in the central node by using RF transceivers with integrated ARM microcontroller. The proposed UWB-SN uses wireless RF communication by using FSK modulation in free short range devices (SRD) 868-870 MHz frequency band concurrently with operation of the UWB radar front-end.

The paper comprises two parts. A spatial scaled simulation model for Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) analysis and a spatial scaled experiment are elaborated to evaluate the VLC propagation channel model in an inhomogeneous street lighting channel. As a first result, a minor improved non Line of Sight (NLoS) ceiling bounce simulation substantially agrees with the measurement. The model is sufficient adequate for a path loss estimation in a larger spatial dimension. As a second result, the receiver requires a huge aperture of 10 to 30 cm diameter for a communication performance of wireless sensor networks between the lights. The Line of Sight (LoS) link requires nearly a quarter of the surface but pointing errors are likely due to the rural outdoor environment. Furthermore, the spatial simulation resolution considering a small Field of View (FOV) influences the gain of up to 5 dB and has therefore been identified as a new error source in the NLoS propagation model whereby the influence is negligible at medium distances.","","","10.23919/ConTEL.2017.8000035","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8000035","visible light communications;smart lighting;optical wireless;free space optic","Optical transmitters;Lighting;Nonlinear optics;Signal to noise ratio;Optical receivers;Noise measurement","free-space optical communication;lighting","optical wireless performance;public street lighting;visible light communication;spatial scaled simulation model;VLC propagation channel model;improved non line of sight ceiling bounce simulation;wireless sensor networks","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The receiver tackles the phase, frequency and timing synchronization problem arising at low SNR. This is achieved by a combination of simple algorithms, which estimate frequency offsets on a pre- and postamble structure as well as jointly with a Turbo decoder. On top of that, payload cyclic redundancy check is used to test a number of frequency and timing hypotheses. This is done such that the computational complexity is in the order to that of classical receiver architectures in higher SNR regions. By means of Monte Carlo simulations, we could show that there were practically no degradations due to frequency and timing offsets. The burst error rate performance of the proposed system with all the synchronization units in operation was at least equal to that obtained over ideal AWGN.","","","10.23919/ConTEL.2017.8000038","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8000038","Low SNR;Burst transmission;Synchronization;DVB-RCS","Signal to noise ratio;Receivers;Payloads;Frequency estimation;Testing;Synchronization","adaptive codes;decoding;Monte Carlo methods;satellite communication;time division multiple access;turbo codes","receiver architecture;burst reception;interactive satellite communication systems;Ka-band;MF-TDMA system;Turbo decoder;payload cyclic redundancy check;Monte Carlo simulations;AWGN;burst error rate","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Also, Active Queue Management (AQM) algorithms share the same goal of congestion mitigation with TCP, in particular, the most effective congestion control occurs when AQM and TCP work together. This paper presents a brief survey and a cross-comparison of the latest and most important TCP and AQM variants, then provides an evaluation of a different kind of performance (multiple Round-Trip Time, long delay, different congestion level, etc.) on the ns-3 network simulator over various types of environments.

The utility function computes weighted sums of various parameters, such as node centrality, similarity, trust, etc. Most of the existing solutions pre-compute the weights based on offline observations, and apply the same values regardless of a node's context. However, since mobile networks are extremely varied in terms of node type and behavior, this approach might prove not to be optimal. The network might be split into sub-networks that behave differently from each other (for instance, a group of nodes from the network might have many contacts, whereas some nodes might spend hours without encountering other peers). Thus, in this paper we wish to lay the foundation for a dynamic data routing solution for opportunistic networks. We show that nodes do indeed behave differently and have different views of the network, but that familiar nodes (i.e., that meet each other often for long periods of time) are alike in terms of behavior. Furthermore, we adapt an existing dissemination solution to dynamically adjust the weights of the utility function based on a node's context, and show through simulations that it behaves better than the static version. This would allow us to pre-compute the weights of the utility function and dynamically change them as a node's view of the network is modified, leading to a more efficient dissemination.","","","10.23919/ConTEL.2017.8000043","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8000043","opportunistic;networking;dynamic;mobile","Peer-to-peer computing;Measurement;Routing;Mobile computing;History;Mobile communication;Social network services","mobile communication;telecommunication network routing","dynamic data routing solution;opportunistic networks;message delivery;mobile networks;utility function","","3","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In most of these methods, the output of a decision is a bitrate value, and the decided bitrate continues until the next decision. This paper models the behavior of video packets on a mobile uplink and proposes a novel bitrate control method. In the method, the output of a decision is the bitrate change over time for several seconds into the future, not a bitrate value, that maximizes an integrated value of the quality of experience (QoE) indicator for the model of behavior.

Recently, there have been efforts in applying the SDN approach to wireless and cellular networks. In fact, SDN is considered as one of the key enablers for future 5G communication networks. Information-centric networking (ICN) is another emerging communication paradigm that has been proposed to improve the content delivery efficiency compared to the traditional host-centric communication protocols. ICN decouples the data from their location, application, and means of transportation. This feature makes ICN particularly suitable for efficient dissemination of large volumes of data, especially in highly dynamic and heterogeneous mobile environments. In this work, we consider an SDN-enabled cellular network and propose an ICN protocol to ensure fast and efficient content dissemination to mobile users.

Facebook models connections between its users through the concept of “friendship”. However, the type and intensity of these connections between different people on Facebook vary significantly. In most cases, friends on Facebook correspond to mere acquaintances in real-life, with only a smaller subset representing actual close friends. The aim of research presented in this paper is to provide a method for estimating the intensity of Facebook friendships, i.e., to distinguish connections representing close friends from others. The study was performed by analyzing Facebook interactions between users (e.g. number of mutual likes, comments, shared photos, etc.) using supervised learning algorithms for binary classification of data. Among the chosen algorithms, the best results were gained by using random forest algorithm - accuracy of 84.73%.","","","10.23919/ConTEL.2017.8000052","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8000052","online social networks;Facebook;supervised learning algorithms;close friends;binary classification","Facebook;Classification algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis;Data models;Supervised learning;Prediction algorithms","Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;social networking (online)","best friend discovery;online social network;OSN;Internet infrastructure;Facebook friendships;Facebook interaction analysis;supervised learning algorithms;binary data classification;random forest algorithm","","1","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Communication is a key component of Smart Grid applicability. To satisfy Quality of Service (QoS) needs when deciding on network structure and topology, especially in urban areas, artificial intelligence techniques may be applied. Techniques such as clustering methods or genetic algorithms are useful to resolve this optimization problem. Choice of network topology for a specific electrical grid is also important. This choice influences the resulting QoS and network implementation price. This paper uses graph theory formulation to create a model. This model is designed to optimize topology of data network while accounting for delay constrains. Since this problem belongs to class NP-hard, this paper indicates appropriate clustering methods that best suit a given Smart Grid scenario in terms of QoS. A typical wireless network planning scenario of electric energy distribution is used as a case study. Each resulting cluster will contain a base station to attend the needs of Smart Grid Intelligent electronic devices in its cluster area. The algorithms K-medoids and K-means had the best performance with K-medoids bringing financial benefits regarding base station deployment.","","","10.1109/ICNSC.2017.8000059","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8000059","Clustering;Smart Grid;communications;Quality of Service (QoS);network analysis","Smart grids;Quality of service;Delays;Wireless communication;Clustering methods;Planning","artificial intelligence;computational complexity;distribution networks;genetic algorithms;graph theory;pattern clustering;power engineering computing;quality of service;smart power grids","clustering techniques;data network planning;smart grids;electricity distribution;quality of service;QoS;artificial intelligence;genetic algorithms;optimization problem;data network topology;electrical grid;graph theory;NP-hard problem;wireless network planning;electric energy distribution;smart grid intelligent electronic devices;K-medoids algorithm;K-means algorithm","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Because of the creation and expansion of new and existing sensor networks, the need to define a common standard for sensors' interfaces representation has arisen. Currently it is difficult to make different sensors and sensors' networks interoperate seamlessly, since their interfaces are not always well specified or are not ready to be adapted immediately to one another. In order to overcome the current lack of a shared standard, in this paper we propose an IoT framework which, by analysing sensors' APIs RESTful descriptions and the interfaces exposed by smart-sensors, tries to integrate different sensors' interfaces into a common Aggregator. Such an Aggregator relies on wrappers and adapters, either automatically built or provided by experts, to make programming and using sensors from different providers completely opaque to the users, who only sees a set of general and abstract functions available. Semantic technologies and matching algorithms are used to support the creation of such wrappers and to easily discover and categorize new sensor types.","","","10.1109/ICNSC.2017.8000071","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8000071","","Sensors;Standards;Social network services;Machine-to-machine communications;Interoperability;Software;Internet of Things","application program interfaces;intelligent sensors;Internet of Things;open systems","semantic IoT framework;RESTful devices API interoperability;Internet of Things;sensor interfaces;sensor APIs RESTful descriptions;smart-sensors;semantic technologies;matching algorithms","","2","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In such a frame, autonomous vehicles could conveniently carry on the repetitive measurements with a significant reduction in risk and costs. Looking specifically at the quality of the air, both terrestrial and aerial platforms could be used; yet the best solution would be their combined use.

As the number of applications in a WSN increases, it also increases the WSN complexity and the amount of required transmitted messages. A major requirement in these networks is to save energy in order to extend their operational lifetime. Among the methods employed to extend network lifetime, Multisensor data fusion (MDF) is one of the most widely used. This technique can be very important when applied in a heterogeneous network (a common case for multiapplication WSNs). In a heterogeneous network data streams may come from very different contexts and may have distinct representations. Traditional MDFs are not able to identify these different contexts, since they are designed using an application-specific design for the network. In order to overcome this limitation, MDFs have to identify (hidden) correlations between sensors and to exploit such knowledge to monitor the behavior of sensors during their working life. Those correlations in a multiapplication environment could indicate that different applications may share similarities in terms of sensing that could be used in MDFs to achieve better results in terms of energy consumption and MDFs accuracy. In this paper, we propose a data fusion algorithm that identifies patterns in data streams generated by distinct applications in order to find the best correlations to apply MDFs. Our proposal is validated through simulations and tests on real nodes.","","","10.1109/ICNSC.2017.8000074","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8000074","","Wireless sensor networks;Correlation;Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors;Data integration;Monitoring","sensor fusion;wireless sensor networks","multisensor data fusion algorithm;hidden correlations;wireless sensor networks;WSN;MDF;heterogeneous network data streams","","6","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, our contribution focuses on a decentralized protocol with the aim of eliminating such bottleneck. Our protocol organizes the distribution of a classification library among the cameras involved, which also participate actively to the target recognition phase.

In addition, groups of end users are encouraged to form the so-called energy districts in which the energy is exchanged locally or negotiated, without intermediaries, directly with the energy provider. This paper proposes Power Cloud, an Internet of Things solution for energy districts. Power Cloud injects smartness into the management of an energy district by supplying a distributed computing layer that controls the physical devices of the end users, and interacts with a centralized cloud component that manages the whole district. In particular, each end user dwelling is equipped with a Smart Energy Aware Gateway (SEAG), which monitors and controls a nanogrid and a home automation system.

We investigate the case in which, in order to better satisfy the requests from the smart grid, the mobile network uses WiFi offloading that, in its turn, reduces the load and, hence, the consumption of the network. Two cases are considered in the paper: a network with always on base stations and a network in which base stations are activated and deactivated based on the traffic demand.

Every smart grid has a manager agent that minimizes its energy cost (intra-market). Then, it offers the surplus of energy or requests the deficit of energy to other neighbour smart grids. An auction allows fixing the energy and economical interchange among smart grids (inter-market). The manager agent can buy energy in the auction when it is cheaper than the energy of their own generators even if these generators have surplus of energy. A Multi-agent system has been developed in JADE platform.","","","10.1109/ICNSC.2017.8000098","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8000098","local energy market;multi-agent system;smart grid","Microgrids;Generators;Smart grids;Multi-agent systems;Pricing;Energy exchange;Batteries","multi-agent systems;power engineering computing;power markets;smart power grids","local electrical market;multiagent system;distributed generation;power balance;electrical networks;renewable generation;smart grid concepts;energy cost;local smart market;manager agent;economical interchange;auction;JADE platform","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, several issues are still debated in the design of CoT systems, including how to effectively manage the heterogeneity of IoT devices and how to support robust and low-latency communications between the cloud and the physical world. In this paper, we present a novel CoT platform that solves such challenges in the smart home domain by leveraging two groundbreaking concepts: Information Centric Networking (ICN) and Fog Computing. The proposal, called ICN-iSapiens, is a three-layered architecture where an intermediate (Fog) layer, consisting of smart home servers (HSs), is introduced between the physical world and the remote cloud, to support real-time services and hide the heterogeneity of IoT devices. Communication at the physical layer consists of name-based ICN primitives, which facilitate the network configuration and enable simple and effective interactions between HSs and IoT devices. As proof of concept, an experimental testbed is presented and some application examples are described to showcase the advanced capabilities of ICN-iSapiens.","","","10.1109/ICNSC.2017.8000099","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8000099","Information Centric Networking;Named Data Networking;Internet of Things;Cloud of Things;Fog Computing","Cloud computing;Smart homes;Temperature sensors;Computer architecture;Physical layer;Temperature measurement","cloud computing;home computing;Internet of Things","Cloud of Things framework;smart home services;information centric networking;CoT paradigm;Internet of Things;IoT technologies;low-latency communications;fog computing;ICN-iSapiens;three-layered architecture;smart home servers;name-based ICN primitives","","3","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

DSM techniques are classified into technological, economical, and social layers. The technology layer has been supported by the government while incentive/pricing based economic layer options are yet to be deployed. To pave the way for such studies, we present evidence from Bahrain's, a neighboring country with similar climate, government and social structures, new pricing policy to show the customer responsiveness on electricity prices. Moreover, we present a case study on how to use direct load control framework during summer months in Qatar.

A considerable number of them derives directly from climate changes and generates a deep impact on cultural heritages. As a result, the need for solutions able to cope with uncertain weather conditions and increased natural disasters is getting urgent. STORM is a European Research and Innovation Action co-funded in the H2020 framework that is aimed at creating intelligent tools which will gather data from libraries, sensors and crowd-sensing techniques in order to enable cultural heritage stakeholders (e.g., the organisations which have to manage the sites) to implement the most appropriate actions in the prevention, response and recovery phases of emergencies which could impact on cultural heritages. More specifically, the project aims at addressing those risks deriving from climate change, which in the near future is going to worsen most of the present hazards, as flash floods, heat waves and forest fires. As such, the approach adopted by the project is particularly fit for the purpose of being integrated with smart city systems which are increasingly growing in number and variety. Even if safety issues are not considered central in the overall concept of smart city, it's plain that the huge quantity of data that can be gathered and processed in any future STORM-like urban cultural heritage compound should feed into the available smart city systems. On the other way round, the mass of data produced or processed by smart city systems have the potential to impact dramatically on emergency management and prevention activities to be implemented by cultural heritage stakeholders. The paper will illustrate the approach that the STORM project is adopting to mitigate the impact of climate changes on cultural heritages and the mutual benefits which could derive from an integration of the STORM outcomes with smart cities systems through the use of standard emergency data exchange protocols and an integrated framework aimed at improving existing processes related to the three identified areas: Prevention, Response and Policy.","","","10.1109/ICNSC.2017.8000105","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8000105","smart cities;cultural heritage;climate change;safety;interoperability","Cultural differences;Smart cities;Sensors;Storms;Fires;Tools","climate mitigation;emergency management;history;smart cities","smart cities;historical urban environments;climate change;natural disasters;uncertain weather conditions;European Research and Innovation Action;H2020 framework;STORM-like urban cultural heritage;emergency management;standard emergency data exchange protocols","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Uncontrolled rebroadcasts result in redundant retransmission of the same information, excessive channel collisions, and exhausted network resources. Minimizing network redundancy and latency while still ensuring high reliability of the entire network is one of the main objectives of multi-hop broadcasting. It's a good choice to use probability-based multi-hop broadcast approach to solve the reliability and latency issues. In this paper, we propose a new probability-based multi-hop broadcast protocol. Different from the existing probability assignment schemes, it takes into account not only the local information but also the number of vehicles within one-hop range in the forwarding probability with a parameter λ that is the basis for the entire forwarding probability distribution. We can adjust the parameter to obtain a higher forwarding success probability. The main idea is that a higher forwarding probability is assigned to the nodes closer to the source node's transmission boundary. We calculate the network forwarding success probability, average number of copies and the average channel access delay. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been demonstrated by our extensive simulation results.","","","10.1109/ICNSC.2017.8000106","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8000106","","Protocols;Probability;Delays;Reliability;Broadcasting;Spread spectrum communication;Vehicular ad hoc networks","probability;protocols;telecommunication network reliability;vehicular ad hoc networks","new probability;multihop broadcast protocol;vehicular networks;safety information;uncontrolled rebroadcasts;redundant retransmission;excessive channel collisions;exhausted network resources;minimizing network redundancy;reliability;forwarding probability distribution","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the paper, we present an improved scheme based on the well-known position-based routing protocol greedy perimeter stateless routing (GPSR). Taking the advantages of GPSR, we preserve the core algorithm of GPSR, and then introduce the link available time (LAT) prediction into the next hop selection of GPSR, instead of simply using a greedy forwarding algorithm. LAT prediction is only decided by the measurable variables within a predefined time interval. Next, we establish a matrix based on the LAT and geographic progress to the next hop to decide which node should be the next hop for relaying. Finally, the simulation results are given to demonstrate the improvement in aspects of delay time, package delivery ratio, hop-count, etc.","","","10.1109/ICNSC.2017.8000107","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8000107","GPSR;VANET;Link available time;Packet delivery ratio;End-to-end delay","Routing;Relays;Routing protocols;Vehicular ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Delays","matrix algebra;radio links;routing protocols;vehicular ad hoc networks","geographic progress;predefined time interval;greedy forwarding algorithm;next hop selection;LAT prediction;link available time;core algorithm;routing protocol greedy perimeter;data delivery;reliable link;network research;VANET;vehicle mobile ad-hoc networks;link available time prediction;GPSR","","4","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper we propose the use of a gateway that separates the traffic of the primary users from that of the secondary users, the beneficiaries of this sharing. We analyze the impact and behavior of several mechanisms for using this gateway, to determine how to maximize network utilization, use of the excess network capacity, and minimize the impact on the primary traffic. As a result we present a set of lessons learned and recommendations. Particularly, some strategies that use tunneling for managing the primary and secondary traffic achieve the best performance isolation for the primary user, while the secondary user obtains the spare capacity equivalent to non-differentiated best effort, with a limited penalty (around 20%). Combined with complementary queueing techniques (instead of FIFO), other important flows for the user experience (such as DNS or ICMP) can be practically unaffected.","","","10.1109/ICNSC.2017.8000108","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8000108","Internet access sharing;community network;user experience;proxy service","Logic gates;Throughput;Ad hoc networks","broadcast communication;Internet;internetworking;telecommunication traffic","community sharing;spare network capacity;broadband Internet access connectivity;gateway;tunneling;primary traffic;secondary traffic","","1","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Furthermore, user mobility is a crucial factor to be considered, especially when the mobile nodes are vehicles, because of their limited freedom of movement and the high relative speed. In this paper, we evaluate the use of a sub-gigahertz wireless technology, namely LoRa (Long Range), to establish links between the mobile users in an opportunistic network in order to augment the number of contacts and their duration. We evaluate the performance of LoRa, comparing it with WiFi, using the Epidemic protocol for message diffusion with realistic vehicular traces. Through simulations, we compare the message delivery probability and the network overhead. These experiments were carried out using the ONE simulator with minor modifications to model the typical behaviour of mobile users.

Each independent variable of a 2D-systems attains values into a given (possibly finite) interval (for example, an infinite dimensional system depends on a time variable taking values in the interval [0, +∞], and on a space variable attaining values into a given finite interval). Due to the finite-interval definition of some (or all) of the independent variables, it is quite straightforward the idea to exploit, for 2D-systems, the FTS theory developed in the context of the classical one-dimensional system framework. To this regard, we provide a sufficient condition for the FTS, and a sufficient condition for the finite-time stabilization of both continuous and discrete-time linear 2D-system; such conditions will require the solution of feasibility problems based on linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).

Power can be saved by turning off the amplifier after a few periods of the oscillating signal, which is enough to detect the resonant frequency of the sensor. The concept was initially proved by performing simulations in SPICE by using AMS-350nm CMOS technology model. A prototype was realized with discrete components on a PCB and tested with a power supply of 5V. The reading cycle was fixed at 10kHz and a RLC load has been used as model of a MEMS resonant sensor. The values for the RLC components used for the tests are 100Ω, 270pF, 10mH.

UWB radar sensor network (UWB-SN) employing the centralized data fusion method can significantly improve tracking capabilities of more people in complex building environments. In this paper we present real-time performing wireless UWB-SN hardware demonstrator. Its sensor nodes use M-sequence UWB radars front-end and low-cost ARM based quad-core microcomputer (ARM-MC) as a main signal processing block. The ARM-MC based on Raspberry Pi provides processing power for the preprocessing of received raw radar signals, algorithms for detection and estimation of target's coordinates, and finally compression of data sent to the data fusion center. Low-rate data streams (3600-6000 bits/s/node) of compressed target coordinates are sent from each sensor node to the data fusion center in the central node by using RF transceivers with integrated ARM microcontroller.

To reduce the energy consumption, many office lighting systems are equipped with occupancy sensors. Since these sensors have a limited reliability in detecting presence, usually very conservative strategies are used such as keeping the lights on for fifteen minutes after the last detected presence. In this paper, we propose a novel lighting control strategy for an office that considers the sensor output as a noisy observation of the real occupancy status. Simulation results show that compared with conventional “on/off” strategy, it saves more energy.","","","10.1109/ICNSC.2017.8000135","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8000135","","Sensors","energy conservation;intelligent control;light emitting diodes;lighting control;office automation","smart office lighting control;occupancy sensors;LED lighting;energy consumption reduction;energy saving","","3","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For these so called non-deterministic multiple output classification (nDMOC) problems, the relationship between the input and output may change over time making it difficult for the machine learning (ML) algorithms in a batch setting to make predictions for a given context. In this paper, we describe the nature of nDMOC problems and discuss the Relevance Score (RS) that is suitable in this context as a performance metric. RS determines the extent by which a predicted output is relevant to the user's context and behaviors, taking into account the inconsistencies that come with human (perception) factors. We tailor the RS metric so that it can be used to evaluate ML algorithms in an online setting at run-time. We assess the performance of a number of ML algorithms, using a smart lighting dataset with non-deterministic one-to-many input-output relationships. The results indicate that using RS instead of classification accuracy (CA) is suitable to analyze the performance of conventional ML algorithms applied to the category of nDMOC problems. Instance-based online ML gives the best RS performance. An interesting finding is that the RS keeps increasing with increasing number of samples, even after the CA performance converges.","","","10.1109/ICNSC.2017.8000136","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8000136","","Measurement;Prediction algorithms;Lighting;Machine learning algorithms;Electronic mail;Monitoring;Mood","human factors;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","machine learning algorithms;humans in the loop;data classification;human factors;nondeterministic input-output relationships;nondeterministic multiple output classification;nDMOC problems;ML algorithms;relevance score;RS metric;user context;user behaviors;human perception;smart lighting dataset;nondeterministic one-to-many input-output relationships;classification accuracy;CA","","3","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To provide low cost and improved performance, each application is typically deployed in distributed DCs. Tasks of users around the world first go through Internet service providers (ISPs) which deliver data between distributed DCs and users. However, capacities and bandwidth cost of different ISPs vary. Besides, energy cost of multiple DCs located in different geographical places is different. With the growth of tasks, the DC provider's energy and ISP bandwidth cost is huge and continues to increase. Therefore, due to the energy and bandwidth cost difference in different geographical places, it is highly difficult to minimize the DC provider's total cost. Therefore, to tackle the problem, this work proposes a cost-sensitive task routing approach that can jointly specify the optimal selection of available ISPs for the arriving tasks, and the optimal number of switched-on servers in each DC. Finally, the simulation with tasks in Google's data center shows the proposed cost-sensitive task routing approach can effectively decrease the DC provider's cost, and raise system throughput in comparison with some typical scheduling method.","","","10.1109/ICNSC.2017.8000144","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8000144","data center;task routing;cost optimization;cloud performance analysis","Routing;Servers;Bandwidth;Switches;Cloud computing;Time factors;Analytical models","cloud computing;computer centres;costing;minimisation;scheduling","cost-sensitive task routing;resource provisioning;geo-distributed clouds;data centers;distributed DCs;Internet service providers;ISP bandwidth cost;geographical places;DC provider total cost minimization;Google data center;scheduling method","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is shown how the use of UDP, IPv6 multicast, distributed scene handling and specific acknowledgement procedures achieves decent lighting controls performance also on IP based RF links.","","","10.1109/ICNSC.2017.8000156","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8000156","Internet Protocol;Lighting Controls;RF;Bandwidth Optimization;Multicast;Scenes;Acknowledgement Procedures","Bandwidth;Radio frequency;Lighting control;Switches;Timing;Internet;Protocols","bandwidth allocation;Internet;IP networks;lighting control;multicast communication;radio links;transport protocols","IP based RF links;acknowledgement procedure;distributed scene handling;IPv6 multicast;UDP;low bandwidth RF links;Internet based lighting controls;available bandwidth limit;timing issue;bandwidth-restricted controls-RF connection;TCP/IP transport;performance optimization;IP based lighting control;bandwidth issues","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, marine sensors are always deployed far away from the security monitoring. Thus, the secure data aggregation for marine sensor networks emerges and attracts the researchers and engineers. Multi-signature enables the data aggregation with a single signature to authenticate the message under different signers. However, most of the previous multi-signature schemes rely on the technique of bilinear pairing involving in heavy computational overhead or the management of certificates which can not be afforded by the marine wireless sensors. Combined with the concept of identity-based cryptography, few identity-based multi-signature (IBMS) schemes have been designed based on the integer factorization problem and without the bilinear pairing. In this paper, we propose two efficient IBMS schemes under the cubic residue assumption, which is equal to the integer factorization assumption. We employ two different methods to calculate a cubic root for a cubic residue number during the signer's private key extraction. The algorithms are quite efficient compared to the previous work, especially for the algorithms of the multi-signature generation and its verification.","","","10.1109/ICNSC.2017.8000158","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8000158","Marine Wireless Sensor Networks;Identity-Based Multi-Signature;Cubic Residues;Integer Factorization;Security","Wireless sensor networks;Sensors;Public key;Communication system security;Wireless communication","cryptography;data aggregation;wireless sensor networks","private key extraction;cubic root;identity-based cryptography;integer factorization problem;IBMS schemes;marine wireless sensor networks;data aggregation;secure identity-based multisignature schemes","","1","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The approach is then tested on a real-world database containing a set of fall and non-fall actions, and is compared, in terms of classification over windows, against four state-of-the-art machine learning methods. Moreover, its results are also compared, in terms of accuracy in discrimination of the fall actions from the non-fall ones, against those obtained by the database builders through the use of another powerful machine learning algorithm. Numerical results are encouraging, and suggest that the proposed methodology could put solid ground for the design and the implementation of a real-time system for fall detection.","","","10.1109/ICNSC.2017.8000169","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8000169","","Databases;Windows;Tools;Medical services;Senior citizens;Wearable sensors","database management systems;geriatrics;health care;knowledge acquisition;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","falling event detection;health care;elderly people;normal daily activities;data windowing;DEREx tool;IF-THEN rule set;window classification;nonfall actions;fall actions;machine learning","","2","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An important problem is the monitoring and management of services across the edge environment. Therefore, dissemination and gathering of data is not straightforward, differing from the classic cloud infrastructure. In this paper, we consider the environment of community networks for edge cloud computing, in which the monitoring of cloud services is required. We propose a monitoring platform to collect near real-time data about the services offered in the community network using a gossip-enabled network. We analyze and apply this gossip-enabled network to perform service discovery and information sharing, enabling data dissemination among the community. We implemented our solution as a prototype and used it for collecting service monitoring data from the real operational community network cloud, as a feasible deployment of our solution. By means of emulation and simulation we analyze in different scenarios, the behavior of the gossip overlay solution, and obtain average results regarding information propagation and consistency needs, i.e. in high latency situations, data convergence occurs within minutes.","","","10.1109/ICNSC.2017.8000191","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8000191","monitoring;community networks;cloud services;computing constrained-devices;gossip overlay","Cloud computing;Monitoring;Peer-to-peer computing;Wireless mesh networks;Data dissemination;Distributed databases","cloud computing;computerised monitoring;digital simulation;information dissemination;wireless mesh networks","gossip-based service monitoring platform;wireless edge cloud computing;shared services;network edge;service management;edge environment;classic cloud infrastructure;community networks;cloud service monitoring;gossip-enabled network;service discovery;information sharing;data dissemination;operational community network cloud;emulation;simulation;gossip overlay solution;information propagation","","1","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

They operate in the unlicensed 2.4 GHz band that is shared by different technologies, such as Bluetooth and WiFi, which add interference at higher transmission power. For this reason, interference is an important factor to avoid for reliable communications. Due to the unpredictable nature of the wireless medium, the 802.15.4e standard has introduced the possibility to schedule a channel in frequency using Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), but the selection of the optimal channel is still an ongoing research. In this paper, a Multilayered Feedforward Neural Network (MFNN) is proposed as a possible solution to make predictions about which channel can offer low latency and high throughput at any given time slot. Controlled experiments were conducted in an anechoic chamber, considering the two scenarios of no interference and interference incurred by other sensors and WiFi. Results show that MFNN is a valid solution, obtaining performance comparable to the best case scenario.","","","10.1109/ICNSC.2017.8000192","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8000192","","Wireless sensor networks;Neurons;Interference;IEEE 802.15 Standard;Probes;Measurement;Biological neural networks","anechoic chambers (acoustic);cognitive radio;telecommunication network reliability;wireless channels;wireless sensor networks","cognitive channel selection;wireless sensor communications;wireless sensor networks;WSN;interference;higher transmission power;reliable communications;wireless medium;time division multiple access;TDMA;optimal channel;multilayered feedforward neural network;MFNN;anechoic chamber","","2","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Besides other technical barriers, wireless network node lifetime impedes its applicability. To reduce the energy cost incurred by wireless communication, several existing mechanisms typically downscale the power of transmitters. However, this increases the instability of the link and aggravates the hidden-node terminal and energy-hole problems. In this work, we assess the effect of transmission power on the performance of a low-power wireless network. Both MAC and routing signaling are taken into account to estimate a more realistic impact of power scaling in the energy efficiency of a network. Our experiments in various settings demonstrate a high cost of low transmission power in terms of both duty cycle and collisions. Symmetrically, high transmission power ensures higher PDR and energy efficiency in a network with multiple source nodes and CCA enabled.","","","10.1109/ICNSC.2017.8000193","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8000193","Reliability;Hidden-Node problem;Transmission Power;Duty-Cycle","Reliability;Routing protocols;Energy consumption;Transmitters;Transceivers;Interference;Wireless networks","access protocols;energy conservation;Internet of Things;radio networks;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication power management;telecommunication signalling","reliable low-power wireless networks;unstable transmission power;Internet-of-Things;large scale interconnected sensing capabilities;large scale interconnected actuation capabilities;wireless network node lifetime;energy cost reduction;wireless communication;link instabillity;MAC;routing signaling;power scaling;energy efficiency;duty cycle;collisions;multiple source nodes","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This filter was loaded with a Ferroelectric capacitor to tune their frequency response. The center frequency of the first band can be tuned from 1.9 GHz to 2 GHz by loading a ferroelectric capacitor to the spurline section and applying a DC control voltage from 0V to 6V. By embedding the stepped impedance resonator with a similar capacitor, the center frequency of the second band can be tuned from 3.2 GHz to 3.6 GHz with the same voltage. The new structure filter will combine a spurline section with a stepped impedance resonator in one filter realizing two independent rejection bands.

In addition, the algorithm yields a closed form optimal solution, so that any iteration on exponential map differentiation, normalization, and least square optimization in a conventional iterative least square algorithm can be eliminated.

In most cases, direct computation of the CAF by using a conventional method such as fast Fourier transform is too computationally intensive. Thus, a two-stage approach consisting of a coarse mode to find rough TDOA/FDOA estimates and a fine mode for precise estimation was introduced. However, there has been no methodology for selecting an interpolation factor determined by the sampling frequency and target precision which significantly affects the computational complexity. In addition, even if the computational complexity can be reduced by using the optimal interpolation factor, the huge transmission data through the datalink between sensors and the central station still remains to be an obstacle for an electronic warfare (EW) system. In this respect, we derive an optimal interpolation factor and then propose a new two-stage TDOA/FDOA estimation algorithm using a resampling block to reduce the computational complexity and the data size simultaneously in EW systems. In the proposed method, the optimal interpolation factor can be used irrespective of the sampling frequency and the target precision. Simulation results show that the optimal interpolation factor efficiently reduces the computational burden without the loss of estimation performance.","","","10.1109/TAES.2017.2735118","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8000388","Cross ambiguity function (CAF);electronic warfare (EW);frequency difference of arrival (FDOA);time difference of arrival (TDOA)","Sensors;Estimation;Interpolation;Computational complexity;Signal resolution;Time-frequency analysis;Computational efficiency","direction-of-arrival estimation;electronic warfare;interpolation;signal sampling;time-of-arrival estimation","computationally efficient TDOA/FDOA estimation;unknown communication signals;electronic warfare system;cross ambiguity function;CAF;coarse mode;rough TDOA/FDOA estimates;fine mode;precise estimation;sampling frequency;target precision;computational complexity;optimal interpolation factor;two-stage TDOA/FDOA estimation algorithm;EW systems;computational burden;time difference of arrival;frequency difference of arrival;resampling block","","5","","","02 August 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For simplicity, the Cascaded Brushless Doubly Fed induction Generator (CBDFG) topology is usually applied as a model for BDFG. The BDFG-based wind turbines must be synchronized and connected to the grid, without inrush current. This paper purposes an improved Direct Torque Control (DTC) method for smooth synchronization of BDFG. Since BDFG has a complicated model, due to the resistance and voltage source in its rotor loop, finding proper references for smooth synchronization is difficult. To overcome this difficulty, a new model for BDFG is proposed. Appropriate flux and torque references for the DTC scheme are proposed based on this model, in order to achieve grid synchronization without inrush current. A 2-MW BDFG is simulated to show the efficiency and accuracy of this proposed method. The experimental results of a 3-kW laboratory scale BDFG confirm the efficiency of this proposed method.","","","10.1109/TSTE.2017.2734964","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8000389","Brushless Doubly Fed induction Generator (BDFG);Direct Torque Control (DTC);wind energy generation;grid synchronization","Synchronization;Rotors;Mathematical model;Voltage control;Torque;Induction generators;Equivalent circuits","asynchronous generators;brushless machines;machine control;power grids;rotors;torque control;wind power plants;wind turbines","wind power generation;Cascaded Brushless Doubly Fed induction Generator topology;grid synchronization;Direct Torque Control method;smooth synchronization;power 2 MW;power 3 kW","","7","","","02 August 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While adaptive strea ming protocols like MPEG-DASH (dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP) allows video quality to be flexibly adapted, e.g., degraded when mobile network condition deteriorates, this is not an option if the application itself requires guaranteed 4K quality at all time. On the other hand, conventional end-to-end transmission control protocol (TCP) has been struggling in supporting 4K video delivery across long-distance Internet paths containing both fixed and mobile network segments with heterogeneous characteristics. In this paper, we present a novel and practically feasible system architecture named MVP (mobile edge virtualization with adaptive prefetching), which enables content providers to embed their content intelligence as a virtual network function into the mobile network operator's infrastructure edge. Based on this architecture, we present a context-aware adaptive video prefetching scheme in order to achieve quality of experience (QoE)-assured 4K video on demand (VoD) delivery across the global Internet. Through experiments based on a real LTE-A network infrastructure, we demonstrate that our proposed scheme is able to achieve QoE-assured 4K VoD streaming, especially when the video source is located remotely in the public Internet, in which case none of the state-of-the-art solutions is able to support such an objective at global Internet scale.","","","10.1109/TMM.2017.2735301","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8000391","Mobile edge computing;MPEG-DASH;network function virtualization;prefetching;quality of experience (QoE);video on demand (VoD)","Streaming media;Prefetching;Mobile communication;Internet;Video recording;Quality assessment","Internet;Long Term Evolution;protocols;quality of experience;video streaming","heterogeneous characteristics;4K video delivery;HTTP;dynamic adaptive streaming;MPEG-DASH;adaptive strea ming protocols;Internet video streaming;adaptive prefetching;mobile edge virtualization;QoE-assured 4K video-on-demand delivery","","24","","","02 August 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
